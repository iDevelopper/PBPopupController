PBPopupController is a framework for presenting bars and view controllers as popup, much like the look and feel of Apple Music App.

## Overview

`PBPopupController` allows to configure a popup bar (like the mini player of Apple Music App), docking it to the bottom bar of a presenting view container controller (like UITabBarController, UINavigationController). The presenting view controller can be any UIViewController subclass.

Each view controller can present a popup bar, docked to a bottom view. For `UITabBarController` subclasses, the default is the tab bar. For `UINavigationController` subclasses, the default view is the toolbar. For other classes, the popup bar is presented at the bottom of the screen. View controller subclasses can provide their own bottom bar views.

Once the popup bar is configured (see the properties in the `PBPopupBar` class) with a style, an image, a title, a sub-title, buttons, effects and colors, you present it with the above view controller providing a required popup content view controller (like the maxi player of Apple Music App).

Once the popup bar is presented with a popup content view controller, the user can swipe or tap the popup bar at any point to present the content view controller. After finishing, the user dismisses this view controller by either swiping or tapping the popup close button porvided by the system.
 
Popup close buttons styles are labeled `chevron` for modern style chevron close button and `round` for iOS 9-style close buttons.

You can also present and dismiss the popup content view controller programmatically.

The popup bar has a `prominent` style based on the modern Music app look and feel and a `compact` style for iOS 9-style look and feel.. You can change these default values. For each, there is a floating parameter for matching the style like in Apple's Music application since iOS 17.

You can also present completely custom popup bars.

The presentation options provided by the framework are listed in the `PBPopupPresentationStyle` enumeration. They make the presentation look like the behavior of the Apple Music App. For iOS 9, the presentation style was `fullScreen` by default and for iOS 10 and below, the style was `deck`. The default is `deck`. You can change these default values. The `custom` option allows you to present the controller on a part of the screen.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

`PBPopupController` supports SPM versions 5.1.0 and above. To use SPM, you should use Xcode 11 or above to open your project. Click `File` -> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency`, enter `https://github.com/iDevelopper/PBPopupController`. Select the version you’d like to use.

### Carthage

Add the following to your Cartfile:

```github "iDevelopper/PBPopupController"```

Make sure you follow the Carthage integration instructions [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).

### Manual

Drag the `PBPopupController.xcodeproj` project to your project, and add `PBPopupController.framework` to **Embedded Binaries** in your project target's **General** tab. Xcode should sort everything else on its own.

### CocoaPods

`PBPopupController` is available for installation using the Cocoa dependency manager [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). 

Add the following to your project's Podfile:
```ruby
pod 'PBPopupController'
```

## Basic API Description

* Configuring and presenting a popup bar:
```Swift
        self.tabBarController?.popupController.delegate = self
        
        if let popupBar = self.tabBarController?.popupBar {

            popupBar.dataSource = self
            
            popupBar.image = UIImage(named: "Cover01")
            popupBar.title = "Title"
            popupBar.subtitle = " A subtitle"
            popupBar.accessibilityLabel = "My custom label"
            
            let popupPlayButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "play-small"), style: .plain, target: self, action: #selector(playPauseAction(_:)))
            popupPlayButtonItem.accessibilityLabel = NSLocalizedString("Play", comment: "")
            let popupNextButtonItem = UIBarButtonItem(image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: "next-small"), style: .plain, target: self, action: #selector(nextAction(_:)))
            popupNextButtonItem.accessibilityLabel = NSLocalizedString("Next track", comment: "")
            
            popupBar.rightBarButtonItems = [popupPlayButtonItem, popupNextButtonItem]
            
            let popupContentVC = self.storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "PopupContentViewController") as? PopupContentViewController
            
            self.tabBarController?.presentPopupBar(withPopupContentViewController: popupContentVC, animated: true, completion: {
                print("Presented")
            })
        }
```
* Opening a popup content view controller programmatically:
```Swift
        self.tabBarController?.openPopup(animated: true, completion: {
            print("Open")
        })
```
* Closing a popup content view controller programmatically:
```Swift
        self.tabBarController?.closePopup(animated: true, completion: {
            print("Closed")
        })
```
* Delegate methods for getting state of the controller:
```Swift
    func popupController(_ popupController: PBPopupController, stateChanged state: PBPopupPresentationState, previousState: PBPopupPresentationState) {
        PBLog("stateChanged state: \(state.description) - previousState: \(previousState.description)")
    }
```
```Swift
    func popupController(_ popupController: PBPopupController, didOpen popupContentViewController: UIViewController) {
        PBLog("didOpen - state: \(popupController.popupPresentationState.description)")
    }
```
etc...


* `PBPopupBar` dataSource methods for providing label instances (such as MarqueeLabel):
```Swift
    lazy var label: MarqueeLabel = {
        let marqueeLabel = MarqueeLabel(frame: .zero, rate: 15, fadeLength: 10)
        marqueeLabel.leadingBuffer = 0.0
        marqueeLabel.trailingBuffer = 5.0
        marqueeLabel.animationDelay = 1.0
        marqueeLabel.type = .continuous
        return marqueeLabel
    }()
```
...
```Swift
    func titleLabel(for popupBar: PBPopupBar) -> UILabel? {
        return self.label
    }
```
```Swift
    func subtitleLabel(for popupBar: PBPopupBar) -> UILabel? {
        return self.sublabel
    }
```

## Managing the status bar

Since iOSS 13, the status bar is not animated correctly by Apple.
So, you can set the properties:

`popupPreferredStatusBarStyle` for the preferred status bar style of the popup content view controller,
`containerPreferredStatusBarStyle` for preferred status bar style of the container view controller.

When you override the `preferredStatusBarStyle` variable in your popup content view controller, return container.popupController.popupStatusBarStyle:

```Swift
    override public var preferredStatusBarStyle: UIStatusBarStyle {
        guard let containerVC = self.popupContainerViewController else {return.default}
        guard let popupContentView = containerVC.popupContentView else {return .default}
    
        if popupContentView.popupPresentationStyle != .deck {
            return .default
        }
        return containerVC.popupController.popupStatusBarStyle
    }
```
